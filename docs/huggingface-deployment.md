# Platinum/Palladium Calibration Studio

An AI-powered calibration system for platinum/palladium alternative photographic printing.

## Features

### Core Calibration
- **Step Tablet Reading**: Automated detection and density extraction from scanned step tablets
- **Curve Generation**: Create linearization curves for digital negatives
- **Multi-Format Export**: Export to QuadTone RIP, Piezography, CSV, and JSON

### Image Processing
- **Image Preview**: Preview curve effects on images before processing
- **Digital Negative Creation**: Create inverted negatives with curves applied
- **Histogram Analysis**: Zone-based tonal distribution analysis

### Printing Tools
- **Chemistry Calculator**: Calculate coating solutions based on Bostick-Sullivan formulas
- **Exposure Calculator**: UV exposure calculations with test strip generator
- **Zone System**: Ansel Adams zone analysis with development recommendations
- **Soft Proofing**: Preview prints on different paper types

### AI Assistance
- **Natural Language Chat**: Ask questions about Pt/Pd printing
- **Recipe Suggestions**: Get customized coating recipes
- **Troubleshooting**: Diagnose common problems with AI guidance

## Usage

1. **Upload a step tablet scan** in the "Step Tablet" tab
2. **Generate curves** using the automatic or manual curve editor
3. **Preview effects** on your images in the "Image Preview" tab
4. **Export** curves in your preferred format
5. **Calculate chemistry** and exposure settings for your prints
