# Platinum/Palladium Chemistry Fundamentals
## Category: Domain Knowledge - Chemistry
## Application: Pt/Pd alternative photographic printing

## Sensitizer Components

### Ferric Oxalate (FO)
- Solution A: Plain 27% ferric oxalate in distilled water
- Solution B (for Pt): 27% FO + 0.3% potassium chlorate (contrast agent)
- Solution B (for Pd): 27% FO + 0.6% potassium chlorate
- Higher chlorate = higher contrast but increased grain risk
- Shelf life: 6-12 months in amber glass, refrigerated

### Platinum Salt
- Potassium tetrachloroplatinate(II), K2PtCl4
- Typically used as 15-20% aqueous solution
- Produces neutral to cool black tones
- More expensive than palladium

### Palladium Salt
- Sodium tetrachloropalladate(II), Na2PdCl4 (Malde-Ware method)
- Or Palladium chloride PdCl2 + NaCl (traditional)
- 15-20% aqueous solution
- Produces warm brown tones
- Less expensive than platinum

## Common Ratios and Their Tonal Effects

| Pt:Pd Ratio | Tone             | Notes                                |
|-------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 100:0       | Neutral black    | Expensive, needs Pd catalyst drop    |
| 80:20       | Cool neutral     | Most "platinum print" look           |
| 50:50       | Neutral-warm     | Cone Editions standard, good balance |
| 20:80       | Warm brown       | More economical                      |
| 0:100       | Warm sepia-brown | Least expensive, most warmth         |

## Contrast Control Methods

1. **A/B Ratio Method**: Vary Solution A (no chlorate) vs Solution B (with chlorate)
2. **Hydrogen Peroxide**: 1-3 drops of 3% H2O2 per coating, mild contrast increase
3. **Dichromate**: Potassium or ammonium dichromate, strong contrast but toxic
4. **Na2 Method**: Sodium hexachloroplatinate, gentler contrast control
5. **Negative density range**: Primary contrast control through digital negative

## Bostick-Sullivan Formula Reference

### Standard Coating (8x10 inch print)
- Ferric Oxalate: 12-14 drops (A+B combined)
- Platinum/Palladium solution: 12-14 drops
- Total: ~24-28 drops (~1.2-1.4 mL)
- Contrast agent (optional): 1-3 drops H2O2

### Malde-Ware Method (Ammonium-based, printing-out)
- Ammonium ferric oxalate: 0.6-0.8 mL
- Pt/Pd solution: 0.4-0.6 mL
- No separate development step needed
- Superior dMax, smoother tones
- More sensitive to humidity

## Safety Considerations
- Ferric oxalate: mild irritant, stains skin yellow (temporary)
- Platinum/palladium salts: potential sensitizer, wear gloves
- Potassium dichromate: toxic and carcinogenic, use with extreme caution
- Potassium chlorate: oxidizer, handle carefully
- Always work in well-ventilated area
- Wear nitrile gloves and eye protection
