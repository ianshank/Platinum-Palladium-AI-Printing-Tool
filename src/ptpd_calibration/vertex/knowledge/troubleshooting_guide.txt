# Pt/Pd Printing Troubleshooting Guide
## Category: Domain Knowledge - Troubleshooting
## Application: Pt/Pd alternative photographic printing

## Highlight Problems

### Highlights are blocked / no paper white
- **Cause**: Over-exposure or over-development
- **Fix**: Reduce exposure time by 10-20%, check negative curve highlights
- **Digital neg fix**: Increase highlight separation in curve editor

### Highlights are muddy / flat
- **Cause**: Insufficient contrast in negative or sensitizer
- **Fix**: Increase Solution B ratio, add H2O2, or adjust digital negative curve
- **Check**: Humidity too high can cause flat highlights in DOP

## Shadow Problems

### Shadows lack depth / weak Dmax
- **Cause**: Under-exposure, insufficient metal in coating, or clearing issues
- **Fix**: Increase exposure, add more Pt/Pd drops, check clearing bath freshness
- **Chemistry**: Na2 Pt/Pd salt gives better Dmax than chloride salts

### Shadows are grainy / mottled
- **Cause**: Too much contrast agent (chlorate), uneven coating, or contaminated chemistry
- **Fix**: Reduce chlorate concentration, use rod coating instead of brush, filter solutions
- **Paper**: Some papers show more grain than others (Bergger > Hahnemühle)

## Coating Problems

### Uneven coating / streaks
- **Cause**: Brush technique, insufficient solution, paper absorption issues
- **Fix**: Use glass rod (Puddle Pusher), ensure paper is properly humidified
- **Amount**: 1.0-1.4 mL for 8x10 is standard, more for textured papers

### Orange/brown staining in highlights after clearing
- **Cause**: Insufficient clearing, iron residue
- **Fix**: Fresh clearing baths (citric acid 5% or EDTA), extend clearing time
- **Protocol**: 3 baths x 5 minutes each, agitate continuously

### Coating dries too fast
- **Cause**: Low humidity, paper too absorbent
- **Fix**: Pre-humidify paper, increase room humidity, add glycerin (1 drop)

## Calibration Problems

### Step tablet readings are inconsistent
- **Cause**: Scanner not calibrated, uneven lighting, wet prints
- **Fix**: Calibrate scanner with IT8 target, ensure prints are completely dry
- **Scan settings**: 16-bit grayscale, 600-1200 DPI, no auto-corrections

### Digital negative doesn't match screen
- **Cause**: Linearization curve needs updating, monitor not calibrated
- **Fix**: Re-run step tablet -> curve generation workflow
- **PiezoDN**: Ensure correct .quad profile is loaded for your paper/chemistry combo

### Curve shifts after paper change
- **Cause**: Different papers absorb differently, affecting tone mapping
- **Fix**: Create separate calibration curves per paper type
- **Best practice**: Maintain curve library per paper/chemistry/exposure combination

## Environmental Problems

### Inconsistent results day-to-day
- **Cause**: Humidity and temperature fluctuations
- **Fix**: Control darkroom environment (hygrometer + humidifier/dehumidifier)
- **Target**: 50-60% RH, 68-72°F for DOP; 60-70% RH for Malde-Ware

### Prints darken after drying (DOP only)
- **Cause**: Normal dry-down effect in develop-out process
- **Fix**: Account for 5-10% dry-down in exposure/curve calculations
- **Note**: Malde-Ware POP has minimal dry-down
