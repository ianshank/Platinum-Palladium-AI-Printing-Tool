## Paper Selection Decision Matrix

| Priority              | Paper                   | Why                                |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Maximum dMax          | Hahnemühle Platinum Rag | Best absorption + Malde-Ware combo |
| Smoothest transitions | Arches Platine          | Hot press + internal sizing        |
| PiezoDN workflow      | Revere Platinum         | Calibrated by Cone Editions        |
| Budget-friendly       | Bergger COT 320         | Good quality, lower price          |
| Large format (>16x20) | Hahnemühle or Arches    | Consistent sizing at scale         |

## Paper Preparation

### Humidity Conditioning
- Store paper in controlled environment (40-60% RH)
- For Malde-Ware POP: pre-humidify 5-15 minutes before coating
- Use humidity chamber (sealed container with damp sponge)
- Paper should feel slightly cool but not damp to touch

### Sizing Considerations
- Internally sized papers: ready to coat directly
- Externally sized papers: may need additional sizing
- Double-sized papers: reduced absorption, use less coating solution
- Unsized papers: require gelatin or starch sizing before coating
