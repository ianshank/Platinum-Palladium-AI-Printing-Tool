# Digital Negative Workflow for Pt/Pd Printing
## Category: Domain Knowledge - Workflow
## Application: Pt/Pd alternative photographic printing

## Overview

A digital negative is a positive-to-negative conversion of a digital image,
printed onto transparent media (usually Pictorico OHP), designed to produce
a correct positive print when contact-printed with Pt/Pd chemistry.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Image Preparation
- Convert to grayscale (or start with B&W)
- Resize to final print dimensions at 300-360 DPI
- Apply desired tonal adjustments in Photoshop/Lightroom
- Flip image horizontally (emulsion-to-emulsion contact printing)

### 2. Linearization Curve Application
- Purpose: Compensate for non-linear Pt/Pd response
- Process: Print step tablet -> coat & expose -> measure densities -> generate curve
- The curve maps desired print densities to negative densities
- Apply curve as Photoshop adjustment layer or in QTR/PiezoDN

### 3. Negative Printing
- **Pictorico OHP Ultra Premium**: Industry standard transparency film
- **Printer**: Epson P800, P900, P5000, or similar with pigment inks
- **QTR/PiezoDN**: Bypasses color management for precise ink density control
- **Print settings**: No color correction, highest quality, matte black ink

### 4. Quality Check
- Examine negative on light table
- Check Dmax (darkest area should be opaque)
- Check highlight end (should show clear separation between steps)
- Compare to reference negative if available

## Calibration System Integration

### Step Tablet Workflow (This Tool)
1. Print standard step tablet (Stouffer 21/31) as digital negative
2. Coat paper with standard chemistry recipe
3. Expose under standard UV source + time
4. Process and dry completely
5. Scan the exposed/developed print
6. Upload scan to Step Tablet tab
7. System extracts density readings per step
8. Curve Generator creates correction curve
9. Export to QTR (.quad) or Piezography format
10. Apply curve to future prints

### Re-Calibration Triggers
- Changed paper type
- New batch of chemistry
- New UV light source or bulb replacement
- Seasonal humidity shifts
- Changed printer or ink batch
- Moved darkroom to new location

## PiezoDN Specifics

### What PiezoDN Does
- Uses dedicated ink channels for UV-dense output
- Provides better UV opacity than standard CMYK inks
- Supports per-channel linearization for fine control
- Works with QuadTone RIP (QTR) on Mac/Windows

### PiezoDN Calibration Steps
1. Install PiezoDN ink set in Epson printer
2. Print PiezoDN-specific step tablet
3. Coat, expose, process on target paper
4. Scan and measure densities
5. Generate .quad file using PiezoDN smoother
6. Load .quad into QTR for printing

## QuadTone RIP (QTR) Basics

### What QTR Does
- Replaces printer's color management
- Maps grayscale values to specific ink channel amounts
- Uses .quad curve files for linearization
- Supports multiple paper profiles

### QTR Curve Format
- 256 values mapping input (0-255) to output ink amounts
- Each ink channel can have independent curve
- Typically uses Gray, Light Gray channels
- Can be generated from step tablet measurements
