# UV Exposure Reference for Pt/Pd Printing
## Category: Domain Knowledge - Exposure
## Application: Pt/Pd alternative photographic printing

## UV Light Sources

### LED UV Units (Modern Standard)
- Wavelength: 365nm optimal (360-400nm range)
- Cone Editions LED units: Custom high-output 8mm 365nm strips
- Advantages: Consistent output, no warm-up, long life, cool operation
- Exposure times: Typically 2-8 minutes depending on negative density
- Ian Leake exposure controllers: Precision timing

### Metal Halide / Mercury Vapor
- NuArc, Olec, Violux units
- Broad UV spectrum
- Exposure times: 5-10 minutes typical
- Require warm-up period (5-10 min)
- Output degrades with bulb age

### Sunlight
- Free and abundant UV source
- Highly variable — clouds, time of day, season, latitude
- Exposure times: 5-30 minutes
- Useful for testing, not reliable for production

## Exposure Factors

### Step Tablet Testing Protocol
1. Make test strip with Stouffer 21 or 31 step tablet
2. Start with manufacturer's recommended time
3. Evaluate minimum exposure for paper white (Dmin)
4. Evaluate maximum exposure for darkest step (Dmax)
5. Optimal = shortest exposure that achieves full Dmax
6. Over-exposure flattens highlights without improving shadows

### Negative Density Range (DR)

| Process             | Target DR | Silver Equiv    |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Pure Platinum       | ~1.4      | Grade 0-1 paper |
| 50/50 Pt/Pd         | ~1.4-1.5  | Grade 0-1 paper |
| Pure Palladium      | ~1.6      | Grade 0 paper   |
| With contrast agent | ~1.0-1.2  | Grade 2-3 paper |

### Environmental Factors
- **Humidity**: 40-60% RH optimal for DOP; 55-70% for Malde-Ware POP
- **Temperature**: 68-75°F (20-24°C) ideal
- **Paper moisture**: Pre-humidify in humid chamber 5-15 min before exposure
- **Coating dryness**: Must be completely dry before exposure
